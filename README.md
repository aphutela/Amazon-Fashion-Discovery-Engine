# Amazon Fashion Discovery Engine

This project involves extracting apparel details from the Amazon API and recommending similar products using NLP techniques with NLTK and machine learning models with Keras.

Personalized product recommendations offer an alternative way to navigate online shops, helping more people find products they needâ€”even those they hadn't considered. By building a recommendation engine, we can suggest similar products on any e-commerce website, such as Amazon.com.
